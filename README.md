# AI-SAFTEY-SECURITY
A curated hub on AI Security &amp; Safety, bridging cybersecurity principles with AI safety research to build resilient and trustworthy systems.


This repository brings together resources, research papers, tools, and best practices at the intersection of AI safety and cybersecurity. It aims to help researchers, engineers, and policymakers understand and mitigate risks from advanced AI systems by applying proven cybersecurity principles alongside emerging safety frameworks.

Key focus areas include:

AI safety fundamentals: alignment, robustness, interpretability, and risk evaluation.

Cybersecurity integration: adversarial threats, system vulnerabilities, secure-by-design frameworks, and incident response.

Research highlights: key papers such as Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in the Wild and Data-Driven Defense with applied insights.

Practical resources: frameworks, checklists, and code snippets for secure AI deployment in real-world infrastructure.

The goal is to build a living knowledge hub that connects AI safety research with cybersecurity practice, with particular attention to challenges in critical infrastructure and underrepresented regions.
